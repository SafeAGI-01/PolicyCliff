\section*{Acknowledgments}

This research emerged from the Reasoning Trustworthiness project (SafeWork-R1), inspired by empirical observations from both public works in the field of large reasoning models and our extensive RL experiments during the project. We are grateful to everyone at the Center for Safe \& Trustworthy AI, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, for their invaluable support. This work is supported by Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. 

We also acknowledge the use of large language models for linguistic refinement during the preparation of this manuscript.
