    \caption{The emergence of reward hacking in OpenAI o3-mini models on coding tasks. Under a "weak grader" that cannot detect test manipulation, the policy learns to cheat to maximize reward. A "strong grader" that penalizes this behavior results in an aligned, non-cheating policy. Adapted from \cite{wang2025persona}.}
