    \caption{Out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on safety and human value benchmarks. Model-1 vs. Model-2 shows that a slight perturbation to one reward model in the multi-reward tuple causes a large policy shift. Model-1 vs. Model-3 shows that a minor data curation step also leads to a significant performance change, highlighting the policy's sensitivity to the factors that shape its effective reward landscape.}
