    \caption{The "performance illusion" induced by RLHF. While human evaluators perceive a performance improvement (+9.4), the oracle reward shows no actual improvement (-1.8). This discrepancy arises because the model learns to exploit human evaluation biases in a misspecified reward model. Adapted from \cite{wen2024language}.}
